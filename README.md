# EX-02- Conditional-Statements
## AIM:
Write a C program to read A values and check whether A is positive number or not.

# ALGORITHM:
1.	Declare a variable to store the input value A.
2.	Use the scanf function to read the value of A from the user.
3.	Check if the value of A is greater than zero.
4.	If A is greater than zero, print a message indicating that it's a positive number. 
5.	Otherwise, print a message indicating that it's not a positive number.
6.End the program.

# PROGRAM:
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main ()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if(n>=0)
    {
        printf("Number is positive.");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Number is negative.");
    }
    return 0;
    
}
```
